## 🔍 Common Commands

### Status and Information
```bash
git status                  # Current state
git log --oneline -5       # Recent commits
git diff HEAD~1            # Changes since last commit
git branch -v              # Current branch info
```

### Staging and Committing
```bash
git add .                  # Stage all changes
git add -A                 # Stage all including deletions
git commit --amend         # Modify last commit
git reset HEAD~1           # Undo last commit (keep changes)
```

### Remote Operations
```bash
git push origin main       # Push to main branch
git pull origin main       # Pull latest changes
git fetch                  # Check for remote updates
git remote -v              # Show remote URLs
```

## ⚠️ Emergency Recovery

### If Push Fails
```bash
git pull origin main       # Get latest changes
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin main       # Try again
```

### If Wrong Files Committed
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1    # Undo commit, keep changes
# Restage correct files
git commit -m "Corrected commit"
```

### If Need to Remove Sensitive Data

git reset --hard HEAD~1    # ⚠️ DANGER: Loses changes
# Only use if absolutely necessary
