# Development Workflow Documentation

## Process Documentation Standards

This document establishes the standard workflow for documenting development processes, backup procedures, and project evolution.

## Documentation Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Real-Time Documentation** - Document as you work, not after
2. **Process Transparency** - Every step should be visible and reproducible
3. **Decision Tracking** - Record why decisions were made, not just what was done
4. **Error Recording** - Document failures and solutions for future reference

### Documentation Types

#### 1. Process Logs
- **Purpose:** Real-time capture of actions taken
- **Format:** Chronological with timestamps
- **Content:** Commands run, results obtained, decisions made
- **Example:** `BACKUP_PROCESS_LOG.md`

#### 2. Implementation Summaries
- **Purpose:** High-level overview of what was accomplished
- **Format:** Feature-focused with outcomes
- **Content:** New capabilities, architectural changes, impact assessment
- **Example:** `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

#### 3. Workflow Guides
- **Purpose:** Reusable procedures for common tasks
- **Format:** Step-by-step instructions
- **Content:** Commands, expected outputs, troubleshooting
- **Example:** This document

## Git Backup Workflow

### Pre-Backup Checklist
```bash
# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/project

# 2. Check current status
git status

# 3. Review changes
git diff
git diff --cached  # for staged changes

# 4. List untracked files
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

### Documentation During Backup
1. **Create Process Log** - Start documenting before making changes
2. **Record Commands** - Copy-paste actual commands and outputs
3. **Note Warnings** - Document any warnings or unusual outputs
4. **Capture File Changes** - List what files were added/modified/deleted

### Staging and Commit Process
```bash
# 1. Stage files (document which files and why)
git add .
# OR selectively:
git add specific-file.md another-file.py

# 2. Create commit with structured message
git commit -m "Category: Brief description

üöÄ Major changes:
- Bullet point of major additions
- Another significant change

üìù Documentation:
- Documentation updates
- New guides added

üîß Technical details:
- Implementation specifics
- Configuration changes"

# 3. Push to remote
git push origin main

# 4. Verify success
git status
git log --oneline -3
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Process Logs:** `[PROCESS]_LOG_YYYYMMDD.md`
- **Workflow Guides:** `[PROCESS]_WORKFLOW.md`
- **Implementation Docs:** `[FEATURE]_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- **User Guides:** `[FEATURE]_GUIDE.md` or `QUICKSTART.md`

## Backup Schedule Recommendations

### Immediate Backup Triggers
- Major feature completion
- Critical bug fixes
- Configuration changes
- Documentation updates
- End of development session

### Scheduled Backups
- **Daily:** End of each development day
- **Weekly:** Complete project review and backup
- **Release:** Before any public release or demo

### Backup Verification
Always verify successful backup:
```bash
# Check local status
git status

# Verify remote sync
git fetch
git status

# Confirm latest commit
git log --oneline -1
```

## Best Practices

### During Development
1. **Commit Early, Commit Often** - Small, focused commits
2. **Descriptive Messages** - Explain what and why, not just what
3. **Test Before Commit** - Ensure functionality works
4. **Document Decisions** - Record why approaches were chosen

### During Backup
1. **Review Before Stage** - Always check what you're committing
2. **Group Related Changes** - Logical commits that tell a story
3. **Include Documentation** - Update docs with code changes
4. **Verify Success** - Always confirm backup completed

### Documentation Quality
1. **Write for Others** - Assume someone else will need to understand
2. **Include Context** - Explain why something was done
3. **Update Regularly** - Keep documentation current
4. **Use Examples** - Show don't just tell

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Git Issues
**Problem:** Merge conflicts during push
**Solution:** 
```bash
git pull origin main
# Resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main
```

**Problem:** Accidentally committed wrong files
**Solution:**
```bash
# For last commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1
# Restage correct files
git add correct-files
git commit -m "Corrected commit message"
```

### Documentation Issues
**Problem:** Documentation out of sync with code
**Solution:** Implement documentation-first development or always update docs with code changes

**Problem:** Too much or too little documentation
**Solution:** Follow the "explain it to a colleague" principle - enough detail for someone else to understand and reproduce

## Process Evolution

This workflow should evolve based on:
- Team feedback and needs
- Project complexity changes
- Tool updates and improvements
- Lessons learned from issues

Update this document whenever the process changes and record the reasoning for changes.
