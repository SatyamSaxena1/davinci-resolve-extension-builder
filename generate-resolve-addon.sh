You are a precise code generator. Read the plan below and create a production-ready starter
project for the specified DaVinci Resolve development path. Return ONLY a base64-encoded ZIP
(no prose, no backticks). The ZIP must contain a minimal, runnable scaffold with README and
clear instructions.

Requirements:
1) Include a top-level README.md with quickstart steps.
2) Provide a simple but real "Hello" example for the chosen path:
   - scripting: Python script using DaVinciResolveScript to add a marker, import a clip, and render.
   - fusion: a Fuse (Lua) with parameters and a pass-through/brightness tweak; plus install notes.
   - ofx: C++ OFX skeleton with build files (CMake) + stub render callback; platform notes.
   - dctl: .dctl with parameter block (eg. contrast) and README showing install paths.
3) Add a scripts/ or tools/ folder with helper scripts to build/run/install.
4) Use portable paths and provide Windows/macOS/Linux notes where relevant.
5) Include .gitignore and a LICENSE (MIT).
6) Keep dependencies minimal; where needed, document them in README.
7) Project should be in a single folder named PROJECT_NAME.

Output protocol (critical):
- Respond with ONLY raw base64 data of a zip file (no markdown, no explanation).
- The zip root must be named PROJECT_NAME.
