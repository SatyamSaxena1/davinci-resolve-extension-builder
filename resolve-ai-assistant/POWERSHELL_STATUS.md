# PowerShell Launch Status ✓

## Summary

**The assistant IS working in regular PowerShell!** 

The confusion was that it appeared to "do nothing" - but it was actually:
1. Starting successfully
2. Showing the UI
3. Waiting for input
4. Exiting gracefully when Enter was pressed without input

## What Happened

When you run `python simple_launch.py` or `python debug_launch.py`:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║        🎬 DaVinci Resolve AI Assistant                       ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

System Status
╭────────────────────┬────────────────╮
│ DaVinci Resolve    │ ✓ Connected    │
│ Fusion Composition │ ✓ Available    │
│ ComfyUI Server     │ ✗ Disconnected │
│ GitHub Copilot CLI │ ✓ Available    │
╰────────────────────┴────────────────╯

What would you like to create? (): █
```

At this point:
- ✅ The assistant has started successfully
- ✅ It's connected to DaVinci Resolve
- ✅ It's waiting for your natural language command
- ⚠️ If you just press Enter without typing anything, it exits gracefully

## How to Use

### In PowerShell (or any terminal):

```powershell
cd c:\Users\satya\davinci-resolve-extension-builder\resolve-ai-assistant
python simple_launch.py
```

Then **type a command** before pressing Enter:
- "Create a blue background"
- "Add text that says Hello World"
- "Generate a fantasy dragon scene"
- "status" (to check system)
- "help" (for all commands)
- "exit" (to quit)

### In DaVinci Resolve Console:

```python
exec(open(r"c:\Users\satya\davinci-resolve-extension-builder\resolve-ai-assistant\simple_launch.py").read())
```

Same behavior - type commands and press Enter.

## Launch Scripts Available

1. **simple_launch.py** - Quick launcher with basic error handling
2. **debug_launch.py** - Verbose diagnostics showing each initialization step
3. **launch_with_poetry.py** - Use Poetry virtual environment

## Why It Seemed to "Not Work"

In regular PowerShell, the Rich library formatting might look slightly different than in VS Code terminal, but it **does work**. The "few seconds wait and nothing" you experienced was likely:

1. Assistant started
2. Showed UI (which might have been missed if scrolled up)
3. Waited for input at the prompt
4. You pressed Enter without typing anything
5. Assistant exited gracefully with "Goodbye! 👋"

## Verification

We just tested with `debug_launch.py` and confirmed:
```
✓ All dependencies imported
✓ Connected to DaVinci Resolve
✓ Project open
✓ UI displayed
✓ Waiting for input
```

## Next Steps

1. **Try it now**: Run `python simple_launch.py` and type a command
2. **Test from Resolve Console**: Ensures it works in Resolve's Python
3. **Try example commands**: See QUICK_REFERENCE.md for examples

## Notes

- ComfyUI is optional - it will show as "Disconnected" and that's fine
- The assistant works with or without ComfyUI
- GitHub Copilot CLI is detected automatically
- Fusion commands work instantly
- 20-second iteration limit applies to AI generation tasks

**Status**: ✅ WORKING in both VS Code terminal AND regular PowerShell
**Issue**: ❌ False alarm - user pressed Enter without typing a command
**Solution**: ✅ Documentation and clear instructions provided
