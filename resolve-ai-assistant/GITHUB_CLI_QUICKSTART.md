# GitHub CLI Integration - Quick Start

## What We Just Built

Your DaVinci Resolve AI Assistant now has **GitHub CLI integration**! This means you can manage your repository, issues, PRs, releases, and CI/CD - all while editing videos in DaVinci Resolve.

## 🎯 Quick Test

### 1. Check if GitHub CLI is installed:
```powershell
gh --version
```

If not installed:
```powershell
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

### 2. Authenticate:
```powershell
gh auth login
```

### 3. Run test script:
```powershell
cd resolve-ai-assistant
poetry run python test_github_integration.py
```

This will verify:
- ✅ GitHub CLI is installed
- ✅ You're authenticated
- ✅ 16+ tools are available
- ✅ Permission system works

### 4. Try it in VS Code:

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select:
- **"Developer: Reload Window"** (to load the updated extension)

Then press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host.

In the Extension Development Host, open a chat and try:
```
@resolve list issues
```

## 💡 Example Commands

### Simple Commands
```
@resolve show repository info
@resolve list recent issues
@resolve show workflow runs
@resolve list releases
```

### Create Operations (require permission)
```
@resolve create issue about bug in preview playback
@resolve create PR for the new glow effect
@resolve release version 0.3.0
```

### Combined Workflows
```
@resolve create lower-third with red text and open PR

This will:
1. Create Fusion composition
2. Play 20s preview
3. Create PR with demo
```

```
@resolve there's a bug where text color is wrong, create an issue

This will:
1. Show current behavior in composition
2. Create issue with reproduction steps
```

## 📁 What Was Created

### Python Backend
- **`github_tools.py`** - 16+ GitHub CLI tool definitions
- **`github_executor.py`** - Safe command execution with permissions
- **`github_resolve_workflows.py`** - 6 complete workflow examples
- **`test_github_integration.py`** - Test suite

### TypeScript Extension
- **Updated `pythonBridge.ts`** - Added GitHub CLI methods
- **Updated `chatParticipant.ts`** - Added GitHub step detection and routing

### Documentation
- **`GITHUB_INTEGRATION.md`** - Comprehensive guide (450+ lines)
- **`GITHUB_CLI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Implementation summary
- **Updated `README.md`** - Added GitHub features

## 🔑 Key Features

### 16+ GitHub CLI Tools
- **Repository**: info, branches, commits
- **Issues**: list, create, view
- **Pull Requests**: list, create, view, checkout
- **Workflows**: list, run, view runs
- **Releases**: list, create

### Permission Model
- **Read-only**: No permission needed (list, view)
- **Write**: Requires approval (create issue/PR)
- **Destructive**: Explicit confirmation (merge, delete)

### Integration Patterns
1. **Bug reports with video evidence**
2. **Feature demos with PRs**
3. **CI/CD monitoring**
4. **Release management**
5. **Issue-driven development**

## 🚀 Try These Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create Bug Report
```
User: "@resolve the text color doesn't work. create an issue"

AI will:
1. Create composition showing the bug
2. Play preview
3. Create issue with description
4. Ask for approval
5. Execute when you say "yes"
```

### Workflow 2: Feature with PR
```
User: "@resolve add glow effect and open PR"

AI will:
1. Implement glow in Fusion
2. Create demo composition
3. Play 20s preview
4. Create PR with demo
```

### Workflow 3: Check CI Status
```
User: "@resolve did the tests pass?"

AI will:
1. List recent workflow runs
2. Show status (✅/❌)
3. Display logs if failed
```

## 📚 Documentation

- **Full Guide**: `GITHUB_INTEGRATION.md`
- **Implementation**: `GITHUB_CLI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- **Examples**: `examples/github_resolve_workflows.py`
- **Test Script**: `test_github_integration.py`

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
User: "@resolve create issue"
        ↓
Chat Participant (detects "issue")
        ↓
    Routes to GitHub executor
        ↓
Python Bridge (JSON command)
        ↓
GitHubExecutor (permission check)
        ↓
subprocess: gh issue create
        ↓
GitHub API
        ↓
Result: "✅ Issue #42 created"
```

## 🎬 DaVinci Resolve Integration

You can **combine** both systems:

```
@resolve create lower-third with red text and open PR

Step 1 (Resolve): Create composition
Step 2 (Resolve): Play preview
Step 3 (GitHub): Create PR with demo

✅ All done in one conversation!
```

## 🔒 Safety Features

1. **Authentication Check** - Verifies `gh auth status`
2. **Permission Guards** - Asks before write operations
3. **Error Handling** - Graceful failures
4. **Timeout Management** - 30s timeout
5. **Read-Only Default** - Most operations are safe

## 📦 Installation Summary

✅ **GitHub CLI tools** - 16+ tools defined  
✅ **Executor** - Safe command execution  
✅ **Python bridge** - VS Code ↔ Python communication  
✅ **TypeScript extension** - GitHub step detection  
✅ **Workflow examples** - 6 complete patterns  
✅ **Documentation** - 650+ lines  
✅ **Test suite** - Validation script  

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "GitHub CLI not found"
```powershell
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

### "Not authenticated"
```powershell
gh auth login
```

### "Permission denied"
Check repository access on GitHub.

### Extension not loading changes
1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
2. Or restart VS Code

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Run test script** - Verify installation
2. ✅ **Try simple command** - `@resolve list issues`
3. ✅ **Test combined workflow** - Create demo and PR
4. ✅ **Read full guide** - `GITHUB_INTEGRATION.md`
5. ✅ **Explore examples** - `github_resolve_workflows.py`

## 🎉 What This Means

Your AI assistant is now:
- 🎬 **Video editor** (DaVinci Resolve)
- 🐙 **Development team member** (GitHub)
- 🤖 **Workflow automation** (Both combined!)

**You can now control your entire development workflow from video editing to GitHub releases - all through natural language conversation!**
