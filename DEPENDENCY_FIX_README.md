# ðŸ”§ Dependency Issue - FIXED!

## The Problem You Encountered

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'websocket'
```

This happened because **DaVinci Resolve's Python doesn't have the required packages**.

## The Solution âœ…

### Quick Fix (Choose One):

#### **Method 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)**

Run this **once** from PowerShell:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\satya\davinci-resolve-extension-builder\resolve-ai-assistant
python setup_resolve_python.py
```

This installs `rich`, `requests`, `websocket-client`, and `pillow` to Resolve's Python.

#### **Method 2: Use Poetry Environment**

From DaVinci Resolve Console:

```python
exec(open(r"c:\Users\satya\davinci-resolve-extension-builder\resolve-ai-assistant\launch_with_poetry.py").read())
```

This uses Poetry's Python (which already has all packages).

## Updated Dependencies

**pyproject.toml** now has the correct packages:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
python-dotenv = "^1.0.0"
rich = "^13.7.0"           # Console UI formatting
requests = "^2.31.0"       # ComfyUI HTTP client
websocket-client = "^1.6.0" # ComfyUI WebSocket
pillow = "^10.1.0"         # Image handling
```

Removed unnecessary packages (OpenAI, LangChain, Pydantic).
